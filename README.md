# Manual accessibility tests
A repo containing manual accessibility tests 

WIP / experiment to see if there is value in publishing the manual checks we (HMLR) perform when testing for accessibility.

## Structure

- Related tests are grouped together in folders.
- Test names will be shorthand of the criterion, and show if the test is for A or AA. using the suffix `_a` or `_aa` e.g. `page_title_a.md`
- Each test will link to detailed information on understanding the criterion.
- There will be a one line summary of what we are checking.
- Test steps, and any relevant notes will be outlined in relevant sections.
