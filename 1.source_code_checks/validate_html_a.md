## Notes on Errors
This check throws up some errors with GOV.UK templates which we do not believe are genuine.

**WIP: To be confirmed**

The following 'errors' are `accepted failures`, with the Gov.UK templates:

- Error: Element h1 not allowed as 
child of element legend in this 
context. (Suppressing further 
errors from this subtree.)
- Error: A link element with a sizes 
attribute must have a rel attribute 
that contains icon or value 
apple-touch-icon
- Error: Attribute src not allowed on 
element image at this point.
